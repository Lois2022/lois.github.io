## Welcome to My Website

### Who I am
My name is Egbai Lois Boniface a recent high school graduate.

I am interested in building a carear in Tech as I have always found it fascinating. I also know from my research that it is an ever growing industry.

A good friend told me about Tech Expert Academy and I believe with the help of Tech Expert Academy I can achieve my dreams. 

### Why

I am hoping to capitalize on TEA three months intensive training for careers such as Data Engineering and Cloud Solutions. I want to learn at my own pace and have a personal coach checking on me weekly.After the three months period is over i hope my coaches and mentors help me land a job. i heard the classes are free and i promise to pay back according to the income share agreement if i successfully land a job.
